          <p class="lead">My name is Garrett Rowley. I am a 25 year old music producer, DJ, and synthesizer-collector.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Currently, I am living in Portland, Oregon. <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="a picture of garrett rowley" class="aboutimg no-padding"> I moved here 3 years ago with a goal of completeing my bachelors degree at Portland State
            University. In December of 2018, I made this goal a <span class="boldital">reality</span>
          </p>
          <p class="lead"> In the years that I lived here, I fostered many connections in the music community and developed several music relatedhobbies & skills. Some of these hobbies include DJing (as seen in the picture to the left), music
          production, sound design & piano. Around November of 2018, I decided that I wanted to develope new skill. This skill was coding. This descision came from my will to push myself to try new things as well as develope a new marketable skill.
          I was very intimindated to sign up, but within the first week, I felt like I had some what of a natural understanding for it.
